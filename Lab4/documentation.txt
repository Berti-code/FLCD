The input file should contain, line by line the following:
From the first line it reads all the states separated by comma.
On the second line the file should contain the alphabet, separated by comma.
On the third line the file will have the final state.
And on the fourth line the file contains the final states separated by comma.
On the next lines the form will have to contain transitions.

The pattern of a transition is the following:
INITIAL_STATE, VALUE = RESULTING_STATE

The sequences accepted by the finite automata are defined by the regular expression:
0*1+0

parseTransitions:
    This method creates a dictionary that will be used to store the transitions.
    This dictionary will have states as keys, and for each key it will store as a value for each key
    a list of dictionaries that show the final states for each value in the alphabet.

fromFile:
    This method parses the file and it populates the transitions table using parseTransition.
